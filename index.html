            <div class="section-title">Research Question / Objective</div>
            <p>To convert Tree Cover Loss into Deforestation, we need to know where forest is, i.e., we need a Forest Baseline.  The research aims to develop a Forest Baseline Product (FBL) that differentiates natural forest removal from commodity-driven land use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Methods</div>
            <p>The methodology involves aligning input data legends to create land cover classes; performing a multi-year consistency check to remove false positives and infer deforestation, degradation, and commodity planting dates; adding existing deforestation and forest degradation datasets; overlaying commodities over forests; forward and backpropagating commodities and other land cover over time; and applying canopy cover, canopy height, and spatial filtering to align with EUDR/NDPE.</p>

            <p>A best-in-class FBL product was developed. Accuracy assessment using stratified random sampling showed high Overall Accuracy (OA) in Ivory Coast (FBL OA 93.3% vs JRC EUDR V2 OA 77.1%), Brazil (87.5% vs 79.0%), and Indonesia (86.0% vs 80.1%).

            <p>The FBL integrates open-source and proprietary datasets to enhance deforestation detection and remove false positives.  Future updates will improve accuracy. The integration of real-time deforestation and degradation events allows for rapid assessment of deforestation drivers. An inverse deforestation product will improve accuracy in cases of long intervals between crop occurrence and deforestation events.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Results</div>
            <p>Twitter metrics correlated with many census variables.  Strong correlations were found between post and author counts, language diversity, and the proportion of the economically active population; inverse correlations were found between post and author counts and the proportion of the population employed in agriculture.  Adding Twitter statistics improved the linear model marginally (up to 0.5% adjusted R²), while census variables yielded an 8.6% improvement.  Focusing on districts with high social media use improved the model by 4.4%.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Conclusions</div>
            <p>Social media statistics plausibly relate to socioeconomic statistics but substituting them for census data is not straightforward, working well only in urban areas with high social media use. Future research should address limitations of social media data and develop targeted statistics to address knowledge gaps.</p>

            <p>Develop a framework for grassland GPP modeling using EO data; validate GPP estimates against flux tower observations; demonstrate the value of high-resolution GPP for long-term grassland monitoring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Methods</div>
            <p>Implemented a high-resolution, space-time modeling framework using the LUE model and bimonthly cloud-free and gap-free Landsat ARCO dataset, starting with a land cover-independent scheme, to generate globally consistent GPP estimates and calibrated outputs specifically for grasslands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Results</div>
            <p>The data is well-suited for trend analysis to identify major GPP losses, potential indicators of land degradation, monitoring grasslands, crop yield mapping, and modeling GHG fluxes at finer spatial resolutions. Validation of GPP estimates using more than 500 eddy covariance flux towers showed an R² of 0.48-0.71 and RMSE &lt; ~2.3 gC/m²/day across all land cover classes. For grasslands, validation with 92 flux towers showed an R2 of 0.51-0.70 and RMSE &lt; ~2gC/m²/day. High correlation with in-situ data (r = 0.73-0.90) but some underestimation observed in certain regions.</p>

            <p>The data is well-suited for trend analysis to identify major GPP losses, potential indicators of land degradation, monitoring grasslands, crop yield mapping, and modeling GHG fluxes at finer spatial resolutions.

            <p>How can Earth Observation (EO) data be effectively integrated into grassland and rangeland management decisions to support climate action, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Methods</div>
            <p>Outreach and engagement with ranchers; assessment of current EO product adoption levels; co-development of EO adoption use cases; replicated grazing experiment using virtual fencing and EO data; analysis of EO data (NPP products, time series) to quantify rangeland resilience and degradation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Results</div>
            <p>High potential for EO tools in rangeland management but low awareness among managers; adoption rates are low due to delayed release times, spatial and temporal mismatch between remotely sensed and manager-relevant metrics, and limited trust in EO accuracy.  Example use case demonstrates virtual fencing integration with EO data improving rangeland condition, livestock performance, and carrying capacity.</p>

            <p>Close collaboration between land managers, scientists, and computer scientists is needed to develop valuable EO tools.  EO data complements on-the-ground experience; space agencies&#x27; focus on applied EO products is encouraging.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Methods</div>
            <p>Live plant biomass samples were collected in summer 2019 from alvar grasslands in Western Estonia. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery from summer 2019 were used.  A Random Forest regression model was developed in Python using the Scikit-Learn package.  All Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands, along with NDVI, BSI, and VV/VH were used as predictors. A 70/30 split was used for training and testing sets. Model hyperparameters were tuned using Grid Search.</p>
